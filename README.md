# How to run?
I have named the java files meaningfully but in the file the class you'll come across is tempCodeRunnerFile 
because that is how Visual Studio code recognizes and runs a single unsaved java file's code 
1. Simply paste the file on Visual Studio code
2. Right click
3. Click Run Code to check output
